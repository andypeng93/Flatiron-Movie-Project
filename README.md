# Flatiron Movie Project
Microsoft tasked us into helping them understand the movie industry better. We need to retreive and explore the data relating to the movie industry. First thing to do is gather as much data relating to the movie industry as we can. Then I want to explore each dataset and see if any are worth joining together to create an even more interesting dataset. After that I want to explore the relationships between  genres, directors, ratings, revenues and runtime of movies.

## Resources Used
The following list contains the resources we used to perform our data analysis on the data relating to the movie industry.

* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org
* Kaggle tmdb movie data downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/juzershakir/tmdb-movies-dataset
