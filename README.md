# Movie Data Analysis
## Flatiron Mod 1 Project

**Authors**: Andy Peng

The contents of this repository detail an analysis of the module 1 project. This analysis is detailed in hopes of making the work accessible and replicable.


### Business problem:

Microsoft tasked us into helping them understand the movie industry better. We need to retreive and explore the data relating to the movie industry. First thing to do is gather as much data relating to the movie industry as we can. Then I want to explore each dataset and see if any are worth joining together. After that I want to explore the relationships between genres, directors, ratings, revenues and runtime of movies.


### Data
The following list contains the resources we used to perform our data analysis on the data relating to the movie industry.
* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org
* [TMDB Kaggle Movie Data](https://www.kaggle.com/juzershakir/tmdb-movies-dataset)


## Methods
- Descriptive Analysis
- Choices made
- Key relevant findings from exploritory data analysis

## Recommendations:

To summarize everything above, we can see from above we need to consider the following features when making a movie.

1) Popular Directors - Hiring popular directors lead to a higher average revenue and ratings for movies

2) Genres
* Animation, adventure, sci-fi, fantasy and action lead to higher revenues

* Short films, documentary, game shows, news and biographies lead to higher ratings


## Limitations & Next Steps

There are many features that we haven't considered. For example,

* Time the movie is released
* Movie budget
* Actors
* Domestic VS International

Not only can we consider these features in our future exploration, but gathering more data would help further support our claims.
